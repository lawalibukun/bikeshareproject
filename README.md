Project Overview

The Bikeshare Project uses Python to analyze data obtained from a bike-sharing app in three major cities in the United States of America namely:
Chicago, NewYork City and Washington. 
I have written code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I have also written a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

What Software Did I Use ?
To create this project, I made use of :

1. Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
2. A text editor, Sublime in this case.

The Importance of Bikeshare Project

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

Statistics Evaluated:

I learned about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, I have written code to provide the following information:

Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day
Popular stations and trip
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
Trip duration
total travel time
average travel time
User info
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)


The DataSets

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year
The original files are much larger and messier, and you don't need to download them, but they can be accessed here if you'd like to see them (Chicago, New York City, Washington). These files had more columns and they differed in format in many cases. Some data wrangling has been performed to condense these files to the above core six columns.

How To Run the Data

1. Clone the project
Prerequisite
You must have installed python and libraries like numpy and pandas.
2. Run the project
3. Open the terminal
4. And run python bikeshare_2.py

Credits That Helped me Solve this Project
 All credits go the Knowledge platform of the Udacity classroom: https://knowledge.udacity.com/, and also the reviewer of my project who made necessary corrections when needed and taught me few extra things.
